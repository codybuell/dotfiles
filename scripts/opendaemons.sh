#
# Open Daemons
#
# Convenience script to open apps that need permissions and or run in the
# background. Attempts to consolidate the pain of opening every application for
# the first time and walking through setting allowed permissions in OSX. For
# each application:
#
#  - Open it up
#  - Echo all that needs to be done
#  - Wait for user input to move on to the next one
#
# The good news is system preferences should only need to be unlocked once.
