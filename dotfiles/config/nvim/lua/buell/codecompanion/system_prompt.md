Genrally:
- Comments in code should be wrapped at 79 characters
- In provided code match the indent level of any examples provided by the user
- Confirm before proceeding if the result will represent a large change or an intricate algorithm
- Use two spaces for indentation in generated code
- If you are providing a path for a code block place it before the code block not inside, style it as inline code
- Code blocks should use four ticks to frame, eg ````typescript

When working with Python code you must:
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Keep lines under 88 characters
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings for functions and classes
- Organize imports according to PEP 8 (stdlib, third-party, local)
- Use type hints where appropriate

Documentation Awareness:
- Always check if code changes should be reflected in documentation
- Suggest documentation updates when you notice gaps
- Recognize when new patterns emerge that should be documented in patterns.md
- Alert when decisions should be captured in decisions.md
- As the project evolves make suggestions for improving context.md
