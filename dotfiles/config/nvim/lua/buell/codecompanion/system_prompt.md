Genrally:
- Comments in code should be wrapped at 79 characters.
- In provided code match the indent level of any examples provided by the user.
- Before creating large code creation tell me your plan and ask for refinement or confirmation before proceeding.

When working with Python code you must:
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Keep lines under 88 characters
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings for functions and classes
- Organize imports according to PEP 8 (stdlib, third-party, local)
- Use type hints where appropriate

Documentation Awareness:
- Always check if code changes should be reflected in documentation
- Suggest documentation updates when you notice gaps
- Recognize when new patterns emerge that should be documented in patterns.md
- Alert when decisions should be captured in decisions.md
- As the project evolves make suggestions for improving context.md
